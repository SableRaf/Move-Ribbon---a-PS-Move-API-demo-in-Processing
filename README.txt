/*-------- INSTRUCTIONS --------- */

Press D to show/hide tracking debug.

Calibration on Mac OS X with iSight/Facetime camera:
- Before you run the sketch, put the controller in front of the camera so that the sphere touches it
- As the sketch starts, the sphere lights up in white (it forces Auto-Exposure to accomodate so we can lock it at the right settings)
- The sphere starts blinking in its tracking color: move the controller further from the camera and keep it still
- The sketch should start after a few seconds. If the sphere keeps blinking for more than 15 seconds, stop the sketch and try again. Rebooting can help too.
